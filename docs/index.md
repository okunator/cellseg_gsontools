## Introduction

**Cellseg_gsontools** is a Python toolset designed to analyze and summarize large cell and tissue segmentation maps created from Whole Slide Images (WSI). The library is built on top of [`geopandas`](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html) and [`libpysal`](https://pysal.org/libpysal/). In other words, the library can process **geospatial** data with **GeoJSON**-interface.

**NOTE**: The library is synergetic with the [cellseg_models.pytorch](https://github.com/okunator/cellseg_models.pytorch) segmentation library which enables you to segment your WSI into `GeoJSON` format.
